Resourceful Rails

Basic Game Flow

Objective of the Game: to build railroad track connecting 6 of the 7 major cities and have $250 in cash.

Setup
- 2-6 players
- choose map
- each player chooses color
- determine turn order
  - random
  - custom
- each player starts with 
  - $50
  - 3 order cards

Build turns
- start with player 1
- can only build
- move to next player
- when at end of turn of last player
  - reverse turn order
  - last player goes again
- when at end of turn of first player
  - reverse turn order
  - first player goes again

First Normal turn (for each player)
- player places train on any city
- city must have track from that player connected
- then play continues as a normal turns

Normal turns
Phase 1
- move train
- pickup good
- drop off good

Phase 2
- build track
- upgrade train
- $20 limit

Optional
- discard hand and draw 3 new cards
- this option replaces any other action



Order Cards
- each player must have 3 at all times
- 3 orders per card
- order consists of 3 elements
  - city to deliver to
  - good to deliver
  - money recieved on delivery
- when a good is delivered
  - discard that card (only one good may be delivered per card)
  - draw a new card
  - recieve payment immediately


Building track
- track built between adjacent nodes
- nodes are in hexagonal grid formation
- thus each node has only 6 possible nodes to build to
- node can one of several types
  - clear         $1
  - mountain      $2
  - small city    $3
  - medium city   $3
  - major city    $5
  - water         N/A
- water nodes cannot be built on at all
- price is determined by node being built to, not from

River
- building over a river incurs an extra cost on top of the normal build cost
- +$2

Cities
- each city has between 0-3 goods that trains may pick up
- small city
  - only 2 players may build into
  - 1 node
- medium city
  - only 3 players may build into
  - 1 node
- major city
  - any number of players may build into
  - 7 nodes total (hexagon)
  - no player may build between major city nodes
  - major city nodes are considered track that all players may use freely

- courtesy rule
  - players cannot build such that they block other players to prevent the maximum number of connections
  - ie, there must be enough inlets for 2 players to build into a small city
  - they may block more convenient access however

Goods
- 30 types in total
- each takes up one good slot on train

Trains
- 4 types of train
  - modest train
    - 9 movement
    - 2 goods
  - fast train
    - 12 movement
    - 2 goods
  - heavy train
    - 9 movement
    - 3 goods
  - advanced train
    - 12 movement
    - 3 goods
- all players start with modest train
- modest train can upgrade to fast or heavy train
- fast or heavy trains can upgrade to advanced train


Optional Rules
- fast trains
  -  9 -> 12
  - 12 -> 16
  - great for more players
- extra build turn
  - start with $60
  - 3 build turns instead of 2
- extra starting cards
  - start with 5 cards instead of 3
  - when first normal turn starts, discard 2 cards
